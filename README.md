# Aemeath

An experimental distroless Linux operating system based on the Freedesktop SDK, running the KDE
Plasma desktop environment.

Aemeath is immutable, and does not have a package manager. System updates are image-based, 
while applications are installed from Flatpak. It aims to include the latest KDE software, 
while building on top of the same Freedesktop SDK used by the Flatpak runtime.

**WARNING: Aemeath is currently very experimental, and not ready to use as a daily driver. 
It is recommended to run Aemeath inside a virtual machine with 3D acceleration enabled, 
to prevent your real data from being eaten by the Threnodian.**

## Current Status

Right now, it sort of boots into the desktop, but packaging is still pretty much a mess, 
especially Plasma ones. This will get cleaned up in due time, but until then, you'll 
need to bear with it for a while.

An S3 bucket for downloads has been set up, but there's no easy way to access them yet. 
`systemd-sysupdate` does not use the S3 bucket yet.

Secure Boot is currently missing from the installation.

## Download

Coming soon. The bucket is set up, but there's no index page for now.

## Building

Aemeath is currently built as a raw disk image. 

```
bst build os/aemeath/disk-image.bst
```
